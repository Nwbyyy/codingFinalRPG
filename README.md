# CodingFinalRPG
Having to come up with my own final for coding class so I'm making a small RPG :D
I don't have that much time so this could be overly ambitious but I'll try my best el oh el

Todo List:
(idk if i should start on visuals or internals first </3)
- [x] Make player constructor
- [ ] Make item constructors (?)
- [ ] Make enemy constructor (possibly a few)
- [ ] Make hud
- [ ] Make turn options
